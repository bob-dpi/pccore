<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><i>Signal
Names :</i></font></p>
<p>CLK_I : System clock. All peripherals use this 20 MHz clock to
drive state machines and other peripheral logic. This is used by the
controller and all peripherals. 
</p>
<p>WE_I : Write enable. This is set to indicate a register write into
the peripheral. A zero for WE_I indicates a read operation. 
</p>
<p>STB_I : Strobe. This is set to indicate that a bus cycle to this
peripheral is in progress. The cycle can be either a register
read/write or a poll. 
</p>
<p>TGA_I : Address tag. A bus cycle with TGA_I set is a normal
register read/write. For a read bus cycle with TGA_I cleared, the
peripheral places the number of bytes it wishes to send to the host
on DAT_O. A DAT_O value of zero indicates that the peripheral has no
data for the host at this time. If DAT_O is non-zero the controller
internally generates a read request for the number of bytes
specified. 
</p>
<p>ADR_I : Address. An 8 bit address that specifies which register in
the peripheral to read or write. The peripheral can treat some
addresses as simple register reads/writes and other addresses as
top-of-stack for a FIFO. 
</p>
<p>STALL_O : Stalled. The peripheral asserts this signal to indicate
that more system clock cycles are needed to complete the bus cycle.
The controller waits for STALL_O to be deasserted before completing
the read or write operation. 
</p>
<p>ACK_O : Acknowledge. The peripheral asserts ACK_O to tell the
controller that the read or write bus cycle has successfully
completed. This signal is used in FIFO accesses to indicate that a
FIFO is full (on write) or empty (on read). The controller write
successive bytes to the same address to fill a FIFO. As long as the
bytes are successfully written, the peripheral asserts ACK_O. When a
byte can not be written, the peripheral does not raise ACK and the
controller knows that the FIFO is full and the sequence of writes
stops at that point. The controller sends an acknowledgment to the
host giving the number of bytes written (or read). This lets the host
application know how many bytes were successfully written to the FIFO
letting the application resend the unacknowledged bytes at a later
time. 
</p>
<p>DAT_X : An 8 bit data bus that is passed in ring from the bus
controller through all peripherals and back to the bus controller.
This arrangement is close to the Wishbone Data Flow Interconnection
but the data path is a ring. This arrangement is sometime called a
<b>serpentine</b> bus. The “Port Size” is 8 bits and the
<b>Granularity</b> is 8 bits. There is no endianness associated
with the data bus. During a bus write cycle the peripheral latches
DAT_I into the selected register. During a read bus cycle the
peripheral ignore DAT_I and places the requested data on DAT_O. 
</p>
<p>The DPcore implementation of Wishbone is fairly bare-bones. That
is, it does not use other Wishbone signals such as: RST_I, TGD_I,
TGD_O, CYC_I, ERR_O, LOCK_I, RTY_O, SEL_I, or TGC_I. 
</p>
<p>The Verilog code fragment below shows a typical peripheral
interface definition. <b>Clocks</b> are system available strobes that
occur every 100ns, 1.0us, 10us, 100us, 1.0ms, 10ms, 100ms, and 1
second. The four inout pins go to the FPGA pins. Some peripherals
have eight instead of four FPGA pins.

system.  Note that while the peripherals are Wishbone compliant, the
bus controller and system interconnect is not.
